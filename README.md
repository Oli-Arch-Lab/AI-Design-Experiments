AI-Design-Experiments
=====================

Purpose
-------
This repository collects quick design explorations combining hand-drawn sketches and AI-assisted outputs to iterate on spatial, lighting, and layout ideas.

Approach
--------
- Capture rough croquis and urban/floorplan sketches in `sketches/`.
- Store AI-generated analyses and renders in `AI_results/`.
- Keep short design notes and prompt-intuition mappings in `notes/` so experiments are reproducible.

Structure
---------
- `sketches/` — croquis and concept sketches (image files).
- `AI_results/` — outputs produced with AI tools (images, PDFs).
- `notes/` — experiment notes describing intent and prompts.

How to use
----------
1. Add sketches to `sketches/`.
2. Run your preferred AI tools to generate outputs and save them to `AI_results/`.
3. Document insights and prompt tweaks in `notes/experiment1.md`.
