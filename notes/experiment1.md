# Experiment 1 — Intuition → AI Guidance

Date: 2026-02-09

Goal
----
Explore light distribution for a compact residential plan; test AI's ability to propose glazing and shading strategies.

Sketches used
-------------
- `sketches/floorplan_sketch1.jpg` — rough plan indicating room adjacencies.

AI prompts & notes
------------------
- Prompt v1: "Analyze daylight penetration for the attached floorplan; recommend window sizes and orientations for balanced daylighting in living and bedrooms."
- Observations: AI suggested larger north-facing glazing and deep shading on west exposures.

Next steps
----------
- Replace placeholders with real sketches and exports.
- Re-run light analysis with measured room dimensions.
